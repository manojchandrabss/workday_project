Questions:


A) What type of security concerns do you have around the VPC?

Ans:
   1) Vpc should always have private subnets with Nat attached to it
   2) To access instances we need to have seperate vpc for bastion host attached to IG and Add peering between application vpc and bastion host vpc for           more secured connections
   3) Public subnets should only be used for LB, CICD tools and route it underlying private instances for more security

B) What questions do you have about the 2 users that have full admin access?

Ans: 
   1) All users should be given minimal or requried previleges. This should be handled from organisational level identity management
   2) Use multiple groups and roles/policies for more secured accesing of services.
     
C) What security precautions would you take for system users vs. human users?

Ans: 
   1) I would consider giving minimum or access based on purpose. depending on the users use case we have to differentiate the groups and assign the user to approriate group.
   2) Integrate LDAP/AD will make this more easier from organisational standpoint for more secured access controls
   3) All manual changes should be blocked from aws security stand point and we should only use IAAC
